Introduction 
============

`scampy` (SCAttering Matrix (model) PYthon) is python package implementing the combined transfer and scattering matrix
modelling approach described in [1], jointly developed by the `National
Physical Laboratory <https://www.npl.co.uk/>`_ and the `Centre for Engineering
Photonics at Cranfield University
<https://openoptics.info/>`_ as part of
an EPSRC funded iCASE studentship. The primary motivation to develop this
software was to model the effects of multiple reflections and polarisation
leakage within the optics of homodyne displacement measuring interferometers,
however `scampy` is generally applicable to modelling the propagation of
monochromatic light through networks of planar optical components.
